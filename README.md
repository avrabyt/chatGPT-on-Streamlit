# chatGPT-on-Streamlit
Quick-try to implement chatGPT+Streamlit : using [pychatGPT](https://github.com/terry3041/pyChatGPT)

## Update : [could not make it work after 1-2 usage]
- Despite it works once/twice, Selenium error pops up 
- using MacOS - observed same behaviour in Safari / Chrome 
- Best guess, it's some incompatiblity with Streamlit cloud chromium with Selenium 

Any help would be appreciated :)
